    'verborg' encapsulated within PUSHSUBST and POPSUBST: otherwise special
    sequences of characters (like "\"hello\"") are now kept as-is when passed
    as argument to  verb-macros.

yodl (2.02) unstable; urgency=low

  * Following suggestions by Karel Kubat, several data files were modified:
    global variables are initialized to prevent compilation problems. Also,
    Karel's contrib/build.pl script was modified by Karel. I changed the
    initialization of the $config{TOPLEVEL_VERSION} so that it first tries to
    read the current toplevel version from the src/config.h file, to promote
    version synchronization.

    Some minor changes to macro files were made, and several superfluous files
    were removed from the distribution.

    Adapted several debian-files, updating the standards and debhelper
    versions, removed debian/ from the .orig archive and added an upstream
    changelog file, keeping this file for future Debian changes only. The
    initial version of the upstream-changelog file is this file: Yodl's
    debian/changelog until (including) version 2.02.

    Disregard the comment in version 2.01.03 about plans to discontinue
    icmake. Icmake's build script will be kept and will remain to be yodl's
    main build-tool. Many functions used in the src/build script have been
    rebuilt, resulting in the removal of many system-function calls and thus
    increasing its speed of execution.

yodl (2.01.03) unstable; urgency=low

  * The XXtocclearpage symbol, used by the tocclearpage() and notocclearpage()
    macros, was erroneously defined for the HTML convertor instead of the
    LaTeX convertor. Also, the macro tocclearpage() did not assign a non-empty
    value to the XXtocclearpage macro, so the macro had no effect.

    Added the file yodl/debian/compat

    Following suggestions by Karel Kubat, macros/rawmacros/footnote.raw was
    modified for HTML-usage. With the HTML convertor a non-breakable space is
    inserted before the (parenthesized) footnote-text.

    A `contrib' directory is created below /usr/share/doc/yodl. Currently it
    contains a perl-script `build.pl' that may be used to create the
    yodl-package. It is not maintained by me (Frank), but was supplied by
    Karel Kubat. Note that it does not update the program version, but uses a
    hard-coded version as set by the script. Karel (karel@e-tunity.com) should
    be contacted for any questions related to this script. Furthermore, the
    dependency on `icmake' will probably be removed from Yodl in the near
    future: I'm planning to standardize the package building using a series of
    generic shell-scripts, which may render the build.pl script obsolete as
    well.

    The build-script will now install in yodl/yodl/debian/yodl instead of
    yodl/yodl/debian/tmp

yodl (2.01.02) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed the lsect(), lsubsect(), lsubsubsect(), sect(), subsect() and
    subsubsect() macros (for html and xml use) since the l...() macros set the
    lastnumber value too late. New XX...sect[Counter].raw files were defined
    to factorize common parts. The l...sect() macros now first set the next
    section number, and then define a label. Finally the section code is
    inserted. The ...sect() macros set the counter, followed by the section's
    code.

    Furthermore, added n-tilde and N-tilde definitions to chartables.

    Note the change of my e-mail address: it's now @rug.nl, instead of
    @rc.rug.nl

yodl (2.01.01) unstable; urgency=low

  * Ai, another leftover from the previous bug-repair: if the suspected
    macro call was already part of the set if supected macros calls the
    already read open parentheses wasn't pushed back. It's now repaired.

    Also, followed Karel's suggestion to do system("rm -rf bin/* libyodl.a
    */o/*"); in yodl/src/build, rather than just -f, in order to removed
    any CVS directories that might be there as well. Since this part should
    not contain any useful info for CVS it shouldn't matter that CVS is
    removed.

yodl (2.01.00) unstable; urgency=low

  * Forced subdir creation at manual construction (in yodl/manual: html/
    latex/ pdf/ ps/ txt/), as suggested by Karel Kubat

    Repaired a bug in the man-page construction in yodlpost:
    handle_ignore_ws didn't ignore multiple white lines. Repaired by
    adding appropriate test

    Repaired a bug in yodl itself:
    -w flag eats initial openparen of parenthesized list. Not specifying -w
    doesn't. Repaired by pushing back an open-parenthesis after recognizing a
    suspected user macro which doesn't turn out to be a user macro in
    src/parser/pnousermacro.c. See the comments in that source for details.

  * Minor repairs of txt-conversion em() and bf() macros

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rc.rug.nl>  Wed, 13 Oct 2004 16:35:16 +0200

yodl (2.00.04) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added .../macros/rawmacros/xxsetmandocumentheader.raw, provided by Karel
    Kubat allowing man-conversions for article, books, report, etc;
    Added new counter XXused to indicate that a list has been used in XML mode,
    adapted related macros accordingly;
    Repaired several inconsistencies in enumeration()/itemization(), following
    Karel's hints;
    Repaired references to xml-skeletons, which were consistently expected in
    /usr/share/yodl rather than in /usr/share/yodl/xml/

yodl (2.00.03) unstable; urgency=low

  * yodlpost/handleignorews.cc: called file_copy2offset(src, dest, offset)
    rather than file_copy2offset(dest, src, offset). Happened only here.
    Added some comment to file_copy2offset() itself, and repaired
    itemization() and enumeration() macros.
    Added minor modifications to macros/build and manual/yo/manual.yo.

yodl (2.00.02) unstable; urgency=low

  * - Added the standard htmlstylesheet() and htmlheadopt() macros to be used
    in the html converter to add, respectively, a stylesheet or any option
    into the head of html files.
    - Modified yodl2whatever to deduct the default output filename from the
    last specified .yo file

    will usually require minor modifications

yodl (1.31.18-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * In the lexer, if we've stepped back over all pre-pushed input, ensure
    that future pushes reallocate the buffer rather than underrunning
    (closes: #203599).
  * Check policy up to 3.5.6: no changes required. Work is needed on
    compiler options for later versions.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Mon, 29 Sep 2003 08:23:03 +0100

yodl (1.31.18-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Simply remove root-owned out/dummy.dep files in the clean target rather
    than trying to chown them to $LOGNAME, which doesn't work under pbuilder
    (closes: #189620).
  * Use '%option noyywrap' rather than the messy local definition of
    yywrap(), which doesn't build properly with current flex.
  * Remove src/yodl2html-post/parser.c on clean to avoid bizarre build
    failures (thanks, Daniel Schepler).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Fri,  2 May 2003 09:21:08 +0100

yodl (1.31.18-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Reinstate URL in control file, as it's useful for people browsing
    http://packages.debian.org/ (thanks, Oohara Yuuma).
  * Remove some cruft from debian/rules.
  * Use dh_installinfo rather than the incorrect code in debian/postinst and
    debian/prerm (which looked at /usr/info!).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Mon, 11 Nov 2002 20:34:34 +0000

yodl (1.31.18-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove URL/authors from control file (should just be in copyright file).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Tue, 16 Jul 2002 00:37:11 +0100

yodl (1.31.18-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make startit() and endit() correctly generate <ul></ul> rather than
    <dl></dl> (thanks, Frank B. Brokken).
  * Update Frank's e-mail address.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Sun,  6 Jan 2002 15:25:22 +0000

yodl (1.31.18-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * New maintainer (closes: #111032).
  * Reintroducing package to unstable because five packages build-depend on
    it. When those packages migrate to a different documentation system,
    yodl may safely be removed.

  * Unexport NAME in debian/rules; the Hurd sets it, which confuses stepmake
    (closes: #111019, #111085).
  * ' generates \&' rather than \' for groff -man output, as \' is an acute
    accent, not an apostrophe (thanks, Matt Kraai; closes: #51258).
  * Recommend python rather than python1.5. yodl seems to work fine with
    newer versions of python, and python1.5 wouldn't have worked because it
    doesn't provide /usr/bin/python.
  * Add build-dependencies.
  * Policy version 3.2.1.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Thu, 22 Nov 2001 20:09:33 +0000

yodl (1.31.18-1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non Maintainer Upload.
  * Package is orphaned, setting Maintainer to Debian QA Group.
  * Apply patch from James Troup to fix build issues. (Closes: #119172)
  * Fix Python Recommends. (Closes: #119204)
  * Fix all lintian errors. (Fix changelog, strip binaries, remove
    INSTALL.txt)
  * Remove dh_suidregister from debian/rules.

yodl (1.31.16-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Partially upgraded to standards version 3.0.1:
     - Updated copyright to point to /usr/share/common-licenses
     - First step towards FHS-compliance: Man and info pages are now
       installed under /usr/share.

 -- Anthony Fok <foka@debian.org>  Wed, 25 Aug 1999 02:41:38 -0600

yodl (1.31.11-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Re-added Yodl info page and added doc-base support.

 -- Anthony Fok <foka@debian.org>  Wed, 17 Mar 1999 00:47:31 -0700

yodl (1.31.10-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * [debian/control]: Updated to Standards-Version: 2.5.0.0
  * [debian/copyright]: Updated the address to the upstream FTP site.
  * Various minor clean-ups.

yodl (1.31.7-1) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release, mostly bugfixes.
  * Tweaked debian/rules aclocal.m4 (hence configure) to make sure that
    yodl is compiled with optimization "-O2" turned on.
  * s/-mgs/-ms/g in config.make.in and yodlconverters.yo.in because
    Debian's groff only has -ms, not -mgs.
  * [debian/control]: Recommends: groff.

 -- Anthony Fok <foka@debian.org>  Thu, 12 Nov 1998 03:04:58 -0700

yodl (1.31.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * [Documentation/GNUmakefile]: Removed "texinfo" that was added to
      "default:" in Debian's yodl_1.31.2-1 because the NEWS file says
      "don't make texinfo by default" in Yodl 1.31.4, and otherwise
      the build process fails, most likely my fault.  :-)
  * [debian/rules]: Now, in the "clean:" target, runs either
      "find . -user root | xargs -r chown $$SUDO_USER.$$SUDO_GID" or
      "find . -user root | xargs -r chown $$LOGNAME" to deal with all those
      root-owned "out/*" files generated during a "sudo debian/rules clean"
      run.  Thanks to Roman Hodek <Roman.Hodek@informatik.uni-erlangen.de>
      for reporting a similar problem with the lilypond package.  :-)
  * Removed postinst and prerm and adjusted debian/GNUmakefile accordingly,
    as Yodl's info files are not built or installed for this release.
  * [debian/control]: Oops!  Forgot to add dependencies!  :-)
      Added "Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}"
      and "Recommends: python-base (>= 1.5.1)".

 -- Anthony Fok <foka@debian.org>  Sat, 10 Oct 1998 14:47:05 -0600

yodl (1.31.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Applied patch 1.31.2.jbr1:
      - src/yodl/grampipethrough.c: A popen _must_ be closed with a
        pclose _not_ a fclose.  Pipes were never getting closed on
        Windows NT cygnus.
  * [Documentation/GNUmakefile]: Added "texinfo" to "default:",
      otherwise Documentation/out/yodl.info* would not be built
      and "make install" would complain.
  * [debian/postinst,debian/prerm]: Added calls to install-info.
  * [Documentation/links.yo]: The e-mail address and command for subscribing
      to the Yodl Mailing List was wrong.  Fixed.

 -- Anthony Fok <foka@debian.org>  Tue,  8 Sep 1998 05:08:54 -0600

yodl (1.31.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial upload to Debian's FTP server.
  * Minor revisions in config.make.in and debian/rules.
  * Note that this package was created by Yodl and lilypond's co-author,
    Jan Nieuwenhuizen <janneke@gnu.org>.  He did all the Debianization
    work for me.  I am so amazed!  All I am doing now is uploading it.
    Thanks a lot, Jan!  :-)
